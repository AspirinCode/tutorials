# CALCULATE AND VISUALIZE THE ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL OF A GLOBULAR PROTEIN

#### NOTE: I strongly recommend installing the latest versions of PDB2PQR and APBS from [https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs-pdb2pqr.git](https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs-pdb2pqr.git).

In this example we will calculate the electrostatic potential (**EP**) of BACE protease, one of the target of [D3R Grand Challenge 2018](https://drugdesigndata.org/about/grand-challenge-4).
All compounds in the BACE free energy set of D3R Challenge 2018 had a charge of +2 at the assay pH values of 4.5. Therefore we shall calculate the electrostatic potential  at this pH.
```
pH=4.5
pdbID=3K5C-BACE
pdb2pqr.py --ff=CHARMM --apbs-input --with-ph=$pH --chain ${pdbID}.pdb ${pdbID}.pH${pH}.pqr
```
this will create an input file for APBS named '3K5C-BACE.pH4.5.in'

Launch APBS
`apbs ${pdbID}.pH${pH}.in --output-file=${pdbID}.pH${pH}_APBS.log`
this will create a density file with the electrostatic potential named '3K5C-BACE.pH4.5.pqr.dx'


To view the EP on the protein surface load the receptor pqr file `3K5C-BACE.pH4.5.pqr` on [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) and display the surface by **Actions->Show->Surface**. If that fails try to adjust the vdw raddi by:

`vdwdefine +.05`

or to add hydrogens with the command

`addh`

and then select **Surface/Binding Analysis->Electrostatic Surface Coloring**, and under **potential file** select the .dx file. I will leave the default values, namely the surface will be colored with a color scale from -7 eV to 7 eV, with red representing negative charge, white neutral and blue positive. The charge value shown is that on the solvent
accessible surface of the protein, namely 1.4 Ã… far from the surface.

Now we will try to focus on the binding pocket. Load the ligand file `3K5C-BACE_1.mol` and use the **Tools->Depiction->Per-Model Clipping** utility to make tomographies of the EP map while mentaining the cartoon representation of the protein. Experiment with **Enable clipping** and **Adjust clipping with mouse as below** options both activated. Use the middle and right mouse buttons to rotate and shift the clipping place, respectively.
Optionally, you can create a nice cartoon representation of the protein and ligand:
```
ribspline cardinal smoothing both stiffness 0.8
ribrepr edged
set silhouette
set silhouette_width 2
set dcstart 0.3
background solid white
```
In the case of BACE, the binding pocket is covered by a a loop ("beta turn") therefore it is better to hide the ribbons for clarity.
`~ribbon`
Now we are ready to write an image file. Go to **File->Image**, select the image name and type and save it!

Once your're done, you can save your session at **File->Save Session as**. When you reopen it with Chimera you might get an error saying:
`"Could not restore surface color on surface model with id 0.1 because volume used in coloring was not restored."`
To fix it simply go to **Surface/Binding Analysis->Electrostatic Surface Coloring** and click on **color** button.
